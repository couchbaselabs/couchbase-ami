== 5 Minute AMI Test Drive

After launching an EC2 instance, you may be interested in test driving
your new database node.  The steps are easy.  Below, HOST is the
DNS or IP address of your newly launched EC2 instance.

First, please log into your new server's web console, using your web
browser, at the following URL:

  http://HOST:8091

The Username/Password will be:

  Username: Administrator
  Password: <your EC2 instance id>

NOTE: Changing the web console's Password is easy.  Please see the
README.txt and More Information sections below.

Next, please create a "default" bucket on your new server by using the
following web console screen:

  MANAGE -> Data Buckets -> Create New Data Bucket

In the following pop-up dialog box, please enter in "default" for the
bucket name and click "Create".  (For now, just accept the other
default parameters in the dialog box.)

Next, let's generate some synthetic test requests.

SSH onto your EC2 instance, such as by using:

  ssh -i your-ssh-key.pem ec2-user@HOST

In your SSH session, you can generate test requests against the
default bucket by running:

  /opt/couchbase/bin/memcachetest -l

Next, let's monitor your database performance.

In your web console, navigate to the following screen to see the
online performance graphs:

  MONITOR -> Data Buckets -> "default"

In the various graphs, there's lots of interesting information to
drill into.

== Ports and Security Groups

If you are creating your own Security Group, the following TCP ports
and port ranges should be opened for inbound connections from your web
application servers and other server nodes (for clustering), via
Source CIDR / IP filtering or Security Group filtering.  That is,
these ports should not be opened for general internet access.

* 8091
* 8092
* 11209
* 11210
* 11211
* 4369
* port range: 21100 to 21199
